# Diabetes Process Prediction Using Linear Regression Models 🤖
A FastAPI-based web application that trains multiple regression models on a Diabetes dataset, evaluates them, and displays both the JSON results and a PDF report with visualizations.

---

## Features 📄
- Train, evaluate, and compare multiple linear regression models on the Diabetes dataset from `scikit-learn`.
- Automatically generate:
    - JSON file with model metrics (RMSE and R² scores).
    - PDF report containing:
        - Feature correlation heatmap.
        - RMSE and R² bar charts. 
- Modern, responsive UI with:
    - Embedded PDF preview.
    - Formatted JSON preview.
